# HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING
HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING is an NLP method tailored for recognizing named entities within text. It employs the BIO tagging system, categorizing words as the start (B), continuation (I), or non-participation (O) in a named entity. The model harnesses Hidden Markov Models, a probabilistic approach, to predict sequences effectively.

Key Features:

Named Entity Recognition (NER): HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING focuses on NER, pinpointing entities like names of people, organizations, and locations in text.

BIO Tagging Scheme: The BIO scheme helps structure the tagging process by marking where named entities begin, continue, or are absent in a sentence.

Probabilistic Modeling: Leveraging Hidden Markov Models, the technique uses probabilities to model transitions between different BIO tags and word-to-tag relationships.

Training: The model is trained on labeled data, where words in sentences are annotated with BIO labels.

Viterbi Decoding: During inference, the Viterbi algorithm determines the most likely sequence of BIO tags based on learned probabilities, enabling accurate entity recognition.

HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING finds utility in various NLP tasks, particularly in extracting meaningful information from unstructured text. Its ability to identify named entities aids applications such as information retrieval, data categorization, and text analysis.
