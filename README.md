# HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING
HMM_NER_BIO_TAGGING is an NLP method tailored for recognizing named entities within text. It employs the BIO tagging system, categorizing words as the start (B), continuation (I), or non-participation (O) in a named entity. The model harnesses Hidden Markov Models, a probabilistic approach, to predict sequences effectively.
